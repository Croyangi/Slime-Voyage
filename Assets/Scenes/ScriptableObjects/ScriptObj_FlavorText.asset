  - "When in Normal Slime, \npress down while sticking to detatch early!"
  - 'Secrets are hidden in every nook and cranny...

    Keep looking!'
  - The fog is coming and you can't hide.
  - The Warehouse was initially supposed to be just a tutorial area!
  - Try More Slime+!
  - Stepspikes can't eat or breathe. Not only do they not need to - they just can't.
  - Chunkfish are what have kept the massive hull of the Warehouse afloat all these
    years.
  - The brain of a Chunkfish just kinda bounces around in their hollow body. They
    form a thought when it hits a corner.
  - Bottomless pits in the Warehouse aren't actually endless; but we don't talk about
    what's down there.
  - "Higher ups at Hugehaul are fully aware of the SHS uprising. \nThey just don't
    really care."
  - Thanks to Hugehaul's patented premium box-packing expertise, no padding is required
    for cargo.
  - Though Slime can squash and stretch however he wants, any significant puncture
    is a death sentence.
  - Every 8th day of the week is when The Warehouse accepts complaints!
  - The very secretive Secret Hatted Society makes sure all members publicly wear
    flamboyant hats...
